    <h4> Florence Nightingale </h4>
    <p> Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a
      manager and trainer of nurses during the Crimean War,
      in which she organised care for wounded soldiers.[3] She gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona of "The Lady with the Lamp" making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.</p>
